-------------------------- Method # 1 to Run project on your Machine -----------------------
You will find a file named as "packages_used_in_project_development.txt" , which contain all module names with pip installation command t intall them.
So, install them all and execute the below command in your terminal or just run app.py file as you run any python file:
				      python app.py
ENJOY!
-------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------- Method # 2 to Run project on your Machine -----------------------

Install Python on your machine and execute the below command in your terminal(Open it in same directory where you saved project all files)
                                     pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt

After executing the above command, it will install al required libraries you need to run this project,
Now execute the below command in your terminal or just run app.py file as you run any python file:
				     python app.py  

This will create a server for your flask App, just follow that link and enjoy the project! 
ENJOY!

-------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------- Method # 3 to Run project on your Machine -----------------------
Strategy: Create a anaconda environment using provided YAML file (conda_requirements_yml.yml) and execute app.py using interpreter of this environment.

Now let's get a bit advanced incase the methiod 1 and 2 didn't worked for you:

So, I will recommend to use anaconda environments to run the projects,

Install anaconda on your machine, Navigate to the directory where you have stored project files, open anaconda prompt here and execute below command:
				     conda env create -n my_project_env --file conda_requirements_yml.yml

Now activate the created enviorement (my_project_env) and execute below command:
				     python app.py 
ENJOY!
